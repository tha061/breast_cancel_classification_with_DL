# breast_cancel_classification_with_DL
The goal of this project is to build a breast cancer classifier on an IDC dataset that can accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant.

# Method


# Data set: IDC_regular dataset from Kaggle
This dataset holds 2,77,524 patches of size 50Ã—50 extracted from 162 whole mount slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at 40x. Of these, 1,98,738 test negative and 78,786 test positive with IDC.

Filenames in this dataset look like this: 8863_idx5_x451_y1451_class0
Here, 8863_idx5 is the patient ID, 451 and 1451 are the x- and y- coordinates of the crop, and 0 is the class label (0 denotes absence of IDC).
